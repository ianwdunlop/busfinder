rCharDet
=========
rCharDet is a character encoding detection library for ruby and the implementation is based
on Mozilla Charset Detectors. This is a forked project in a effort to make it Ruby 1.9 compatible

Usage:
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'rchardet'

    cd = CharDet.detect(some_data)
    encoding = cd['encoding']
    confidence = cd['confidence'] # 0.0 <= confidence <= 1.0
